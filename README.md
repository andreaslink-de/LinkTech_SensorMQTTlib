## RF-Sensor MQTT Library for Arduino

With this library you can create objects for e.g. 433MHz Door/Window sensors - mainly created for Stabo sensors ([Stabo Funk-TÃ¼r-/Fensterkontakt 51126](https://stabo.de/hs-zubehoer/)) to easily send corresponding MQTT messages on predefind topics for radio detected events. Setup is done via MQTT based on button hold ID and all other events can automtically be handled.

### Usage
- Create sensor object with predefined constructor to create with initial ID and main MQTT topic _OR_
- Create sensor object with default constructor, then use init function later
- Optimal usage is to prepare an array of sensor objects and fill it later according to setup

### Todo
- Extend documentation
- Add simple examples
